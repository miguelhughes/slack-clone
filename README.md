## Slack React Clone

This is a Slack clone built entirely with React, HTML and CSS. (data is not saved on the server, is browser only)<br>

It features:

- UseState hook to keep state
- UseEffect hook for side effect to scroll to the bottom of the window.
- CSS only rules for all the layout (try resizing your window, you won't see any flickers or positioning after the fact). This includes full height layout, positioning the input below, and having the main window occupy the rest of the available space.
- The effects of hover and click on the sidebar are also CSS only.
